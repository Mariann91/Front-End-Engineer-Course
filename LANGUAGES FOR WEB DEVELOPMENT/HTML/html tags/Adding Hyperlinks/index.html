      <h3>Why You Should Choose Jetsetter Concierge Travel Planning</h3>
      <!-- 1.
Alejandra has begun to build out her business’s website. She wants to link from her homepage to a different page that contains her resume.

To start, look in index.html for the text that says 25 years of experience — it should be near line 20. Put an anchor tag (<a>) around this text. -->
      <!-- 2.
Add a href attribute to this anchor tag, and give it the value /resume.html.

This URL is called a relative path and it looks a little different from the full URLs you’re used to seeing. That’s because it’s actually a link to another page on the same website, so we can omit the first part. Instead of www.jetsetter.com/resume.html we can abbreviate the link to just /resume.html.

Open the hint if you need a reminder on how to set attributes for html tags. -->
      <!-- 3.
Click on the link that you just made to navigate to see Alejandra’s resume!
